This project is a part of the work done for a mobile apps company.  Other projects can be found at https://github.com/marin-stoytchev.

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide user behavioral segmentation. The results from the user segmentation are used for marketing strategy optimization to achieve the highest profit potential for the company.


### Methods Used
* Data Processing
* Data Visualization
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Clustering
* Marketing Optimization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter 

## Project Description
1) A mobile apps company* wants to determine which of their users are most likely to "convert" (to start generating revenue), so that a targeted promotion is offered to these users. 

2) Current data show that only a small percentage of users have converted since installing their app. The available data includes user data, sessions data, spending data and revenue data. We need to use the available data to determine which of the non-revenue users are most likely to convert.

3) This is a user behavioral segmentation problem and we use KMeans to determine which of the non-converted users have the most overlap of common characteristics with the already converted users.

4) The results from data modeling are used to perform optimization of targeted marketing strategy to achieve the highest profit potential.

(*) The name of the company is kept private for a number of reasons and is not essential in any way for this project.
